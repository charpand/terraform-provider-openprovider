# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our software seriously. If you find a security vulnerability, please report it to us responsibly.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them by emailing us at [security@charpand.com](mailto:security@charpand.com).

We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours and provide a timeline for a fix, if applicable. We request that you do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until we have had a chance to address it.
