# openprovider_domain_transfer (Resource)

Manages domain transfer to OpenProvider. Transfers a domain from another registrar using an authorization code.

## Important Notes

- **Transfer Process**: Domain transfers typically take 5-7 days to complete. The resource is created once the transfer is initiated (status: `REQ`), not when it completes (status: `ACT`).
- **Auth Code**: The authorization code (EPP code) must be obtained from your current registrar before initiating the transfer.
- **Security**: The auth code is marked as sensitive and should be stored securely (e.g., using variables with encrypted state backend).
- **Delete Behavior**: Destroying this resource removes it from Terraform state only; the domain remains at OpenProvider.
- **Import Note**: After importing a transferred domain, you must provide the auth_code in your configuration, as it cannot be retrieved from the API.

3. Run `terraform apply` to initiate transfer (status will be `REQ`)
4. Wait 5-7 days for transfer to complete
5. Run `terraform refresh` to update status to `ACT`
6. (Optional) Transition to `openprovider_domain` resource for ongoing management

## Status Values

- `REQ` - Transfer requested/in progress
- `ACT` - Transfer completed, domain is active
